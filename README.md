# Code

Simple project representing the Visitor design pattern. 

# Definition

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

In essence, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying the classes. Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.
